# AnalyzingLogFiles

Developed a Bash script to analyze Bank Logs. The script reads through each line of the log file, searching for each keyword, which indicates potentially suspicious login attempts. If the line contains a particular keyword, It will be added to the suspicious_activity.log. This file will store all the entries that match the criteria.
